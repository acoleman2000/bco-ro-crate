# Tutorial: Creating a BCO RO-Crate

This tutorial will show how to make the exemplar BCO RO-Crate, starting with a workflow run.

We will run the [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow [nf-core/chipseq](https://nf-co.re/chipseq) version 1.2.1 using test inputs, capture the results in a BCO which we then describe further as an RO-Crate, and finally package all the files using BagIt.
