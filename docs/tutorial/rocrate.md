# RO-Crate

[data/ro-crate-metadata.json](data/ro-crate-metadata.json) is a JSON-LD file conforming to [RO-Crate Metadata specification 1.1-DRAFT](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1-DRAFT/)

Here the role of the RO-Crate is to type, relate and describe the individual files in this package. This includes external references, licenses and attributions to authors. This may seem like overlap from the BCO, but as it is here per file it can distinguish more complicated situations such as the reference datasets.
